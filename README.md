# Biomed Derivative Project

## Aim

To generate synthetic data which will most accurately resemble the original real dataset.


## Files and folders

* util/preProcess.py: contains data preprocessing and cleaning function 

* util/tools.py: contains function to create synthetic data with CTGAN, TVAE, GaussianCopula GAN and synthPop

* util/metrics.py: contains functions to compute t-test, ks-test and kl-divergence over all columns of two datasets

* util/plots.py: contains function to generate a histogram, a cumulative sums graphs, etc.

* genSynthData.ipynb : script to generate synthetic datasets using CTGAN, TVAE, GaussianCopula GAN and synthPop 

* evaluateSynthData.ipynb : contains t-test, ks-test, histograms and cummulative sums graphs, to evaluate the performance of the datasets

* plots/: saved histograms and cummulative sums graphs from evaluateSynthData.ipynb 

* syntheticData/: folder that contains gererated datasets
